Head to toes
Flesh and bones​
Should feel whole
But the void
A silent storm​

I’m here to use my heart and my hands
Somehow the bruises changed my plans​

And there’s a silent storm inside me
Looking for a home
I hope that someone’s gonna find me
And say that I belong
I‘ll wait forever and a lifetime
To find I’m not alone
There’s a silent storm inside me
Someday I’ll be calm





Ask myself
What comes next
Will I fly?​
Will I fall?
My silent storm​

I’m here to use my heart and my hands ​
Somehow the bruises changed my plans​

And there’s a silent storm inside me
Looking for a home
I hope that someone’s gonna find me
And say that I belong
I’ll wait forever and a lifetime
To find I’m not alone
There’s a silent storm inside me
Someday I’ll be calm
