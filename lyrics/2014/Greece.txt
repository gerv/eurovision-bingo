I feel like rising up
to the sky like I am a dove,
I’m in love with this feeling…
am I down or am I up?
I can’t frown cause I am in luck,
I’ve got the crowd and that’s enough…
I’m in love.

Come on and rise up rise up to the sky,
Come on and rise up get up and lose your mind,
Loosen up your feet and fly,
Get off the ground tonight.

Come on and rise up jump out of what keeps you down,
get high and rise up fly get your feet of the ground,
come on and rise up rise up rise up rise up rise rise rise…

I told her rise up, come along and rise up,
music makes me wanna, grab somebody rise up.

Come on and rise up dance till the final day,
no need to hold back drink like there is no other way,
Loosen up your feet and fly,
get off the ground tonight.

Come on and rise up jump out of what keeps you down,
get high and Rise up fly get your feet of the ground,
come on and rise up rise up rise up rise up rise rise rise…

I told her rise up, come along and rise up
music makes me wanna, grab somebody rise up.
I told her rise up, come along and rise up,
music makes me wanna, grab somebody rise up.

Yo, I am down to rise up, pour these shots like “why stop”?
I see you shaking, I'm a have to smack that my god!
I m blowing paper, balling call me later, balling call me later, balling call me mason.
Ey, our flow is oh so freaky, I roll with it oh so cheeky, oh please girl no don’t tease me, just got here I’m not leaving.

Come on and rise up jump out of what keeps you down,
get high and rise up fly get your feet of the ground,
come on and rise up rise up rise up rise up rise rise rise.
