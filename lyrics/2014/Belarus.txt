Yeah, baby…

Once I gave you one more chance
You showed me dance
But I’m not Patrick Swayzee
You’re not Jennifer Gray

I told this story
But I’m so sorry
I lost my train of thought
When you called me, “My sweet Cheesecake”

I don’t wanna be your toy perhaps today
I’m not gonna be your boyfriend
It’s too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake

I don’t wanna be your toy perhaps today
I’m not gonna be your boyfriend
It’s too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake

Ohh…yeah…do-do-do-do

Hey(hey) I will fy far away (aay)
By any plane just not to meet you
On my way, don’t stay, (hay )

You dial my number
Your dreams start crumbling
You want me to be the man I’ll never ever be

I don’t wanna be your toy boy today
I’m not gonna be your boyfriend
It’s too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake

I don’t wanna be your toy boy today
I’m not gonna be your boyfriend
It’s too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake

Ohh….yeah…do-do-do-do

I don’t want to be your toy
I don’t want to be your boy
Oh, oh

I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna be your toy
I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna be your boy, baby. Oo-oo-o

Yeah

I don’t wanna
I’m not gonna be your boyfriend
It’s too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake

I don’t wanna be your toy perhaps today
I’m not gonna be your boyfriend
It’s too late
I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake

(cheesecake)
I don’t wanna ( heeey)
I’m not gonna be your boy (heeey)

I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake
Oo-ooo-oo, Ee-ee-ee
I don’t wanna ( heeey)
I’m not gonna be your boy ( heeey)

I look over all the maps trying to escape
’cause I’m tired of your sweet cheesecake
