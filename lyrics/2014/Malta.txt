Freedom of life, I will express my soul
Look me in the eye and electrify my bones
I ain’t gonna leave until you know my name
Stepping out of the shell, now don’t you step in my way
Build another wall and watch it crumble by your side

I’m coming home

I’m not holding back no I ain’t wasting time
If you want me near then you must come for the ride
If your sky will fall, I’ll shelter you from the rain
There’s not a cloud in the sky that can come in the way
Roaming through fields, I’m trying to find this new land
It’s only Because I’m here , I’m finding gold in my hands

I’m coming home
I'm coming home

Trying to build up the words to say what you mean to me
Gonna open your eyes and let you know what I mean

Ohh aaahhh
Ohh aaahhh

Gonna take on this journey feel the light getting warm
Find the strength I’ve been searching keep the beat going strong
Keep the gloves on for fighting don’t you knock on my door
Yeah the spirits alive I’m on the road coming home.

I’m coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
