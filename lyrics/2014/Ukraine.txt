I believe that I've loved you
Since the first time that I saw you
Bells rang angels sang
When the light of the night
fell on us we knew

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We both knew that you were mine
Now cover me, I'll buy us time, time

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh *2

Oh wait for me I'm worth your while
Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick tock
My heart is like a clock, I'm steady like a rock
Sch don't stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop
My heart is like a clock you wind it with your love
You wind and wind, it with your love
Now I know it's too hard to
go tick tock without the glimpse of you
If you cave in I break
I keep losing my pace
In this endless race

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

They all know that you're mine
They can see we belong
Shelter me, you'll do fine
Wait for me, I'll buy us time

Tick-tock, can you hear me go tick tock
My heart is like a clock, I'm steady like a rock
Sch don't stop, kiss and kiss me till I drop
My heart is like a clock, you wind it with your love
