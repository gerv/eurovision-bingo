Something’s missing, but what could it be?
I want this, I want that
I dream in dollars when I sleep
I wear new threads every day
It’s all beautiful, it’s all new
I’ve got the world crying out the window
But I don’t care, I live on the top floor
I don’t even know my own cleaning lady!

My car is lined with leather
I like the smell of my perfume
I don’t like to show my feelings
I lift weights at the gym
My body is a war machine
I have everything I could ever dream of
It’s true, maybe I do have it all

But I wanna moustache
a moustache, a moustache
I wanna have a moustache
a moustache, a moustache
quiero un bigote

I want this, I want that
It’s never enough
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want
I want this, I want that
It’s never enough
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want
I want this, I want that
It’s like this, it’s like that
I want this, I want that
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want

So let me add a little more
To the ton of stuff in my drawers
I still have friends
And I even have friends who love me
I say, I’ve got everything, I’ve got it all
The world is at my feet – its crazy!
I have everything I could ever dream of
It’s true, maybe I do have it all

But I wanna moustache
a moustache, a moustache
I wanna have a moustache
a moustache, a moustache
quiero un bigote

I want this, I want that
It’s never enough
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want
I want this, I want that
It’s never enough
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want

I’d give everything I have
For a moustache
Now I know, I want
a moustache
I’d give it all up, trade it all in
For a moustache
It’s true, maybe I do have it all
But that’s not what I want


I want this, I want that
It’s never enough
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want
I want this, I want that
It’s never enough
It’s like this, it’s like that
There’s always something I want

I just want a moustache
