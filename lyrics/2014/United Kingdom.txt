Power to the people (oh, hey, hey)
Power to the people (oh, oh, oh, oh)

I've been tired of this thinking (hey)
so I've drowned it out with drinking (oh)
Tastes like a bitter pill but I'll just wash it down
With the taste of something sweet that some doctor gave me now
And this is a madness
I'm not giving in

We're shining like diamonds
With fire in our bones
Standing beside you I've a feeling that I'll never walk alone

We're children of the universe, don't you know
Dancing on the edge of time and it's ours to own
Just children of the universe

Power to the people (oh, hey, hey)
Power to the people (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Power to the people (oh, hey, hey)
You know what we want and we've gotta get it now

Something's stirring in the silence (hey, hey)
And it reeks of passive violence (oh)
Hold on tight this opportunity we'll take, put an end to all this suffering before it gets too late
Hopes on the horizon
I'm not giving in

We're children of the universe don't you know
Dancing on the edge of time and it's ours to own
Just children of the universe

We're shining like diamonds
With love in our hearts
They said it's the end but I've a feeling
It might just be the start
As I am awakened with fire in my bones
Standing beside you I've a feeling that I'll never walk alone

We're children of the uni, children of the uni,
Children of the universe don't you know
Yeah dancing on the edge of time and it's ours to own
'Cause we are children of the universe
Just children of the universe

Power to the people
