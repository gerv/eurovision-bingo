Find me,
I’m still wandering the seas,
A lonely sail without a breeze,
Can you see me?

Find me
You know I'm lost without your arms,
You are never ending line
on my palms...

Still dreaming you’re mine,
I'm loving you like the first time…

My love, I’ll be waiting
For you to be in my world again
Don't forget about me,
Don't forget about everything we had.

My love I 'll be waiting,
For you to take this lonely world away,
Don't forget about me,
Let me hold you in my arms
Don't forget about me
Be the sun in my eyes again...

I'm still dreaming you’re mine,
I'm loving you like the first time,
You are all that I need,
My love, my everything .
