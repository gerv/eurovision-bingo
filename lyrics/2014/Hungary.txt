Silent cries
Every night
This Pain don't ever leave her life
Daddy's home
So she tries to hide
She calls for Mom
But never a reply

She cries cries cries
she's all alone
Daddy why why why
Leave me alone
She calls for help
She calls for help
But no one seems to care
She calls for help but no one seems to care

She keeps on running running running
from this crazy life
She keeps on running running running
Never sees the Light
I can see the angels standing by your side
it'll be alright

She's back again
Just one more time
Just wants to see her mother smile
She can't forget
Her only child
Mama let the devil in her house

She cries cries cries
she's all alone
Daddy why why why
Leave me alone
She calls for help
She calls for help
But no one seems to care
She calls for help but no one seems to care

She keeps on running running running
from this crazy life
She keeps on running running running
Never sees the Light
I can see the angels standing by your side
it'll be alright

She cries cries cries
Daddy why why why
she keeps on running running running
from this crazy life
keeps on running running
oh oh ohhhh
it'll be alright
