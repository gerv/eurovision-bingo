<Whistle>

Looking for a candidate you have an option only one choice
Sipping my drinks looking around, there is so much beauty, oh yes we can
But yet, self-confidence is a fragile concept, that often fades away in the night
And there it comes, that unwanted guest, there is no place for you tonight

Want me to go, want me to go
Cause you think I’m lying cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

<Whistle>

Like an evil satellite, twisting the truth then leaving us alone
In this mad and moody world, society without love
I state my heart has been well trained, I’m gonna be your candidate
I am the hunter you are the prey, tonight I’m gonna eat you up

Want me to go, want me to go
Cause you think I’m lying cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

I press my nose to the glass, it’s raining outside, it’s raining outside
I would like to storm in, roar like a lion, roar like a lion
But I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement, I’m so wet, I’m dirty
But I fear your judgement, oh I fear your judgement, it’s me and my
imperfection

Want me to go, want me to go
cause you think I’m lying cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Want me to go
Cause you think I’m lying cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no

Want me to go
Cause you think I’m lying cause you think I’m lying
No, open the door
Cause tonight I cannot go hunting for stars, no no
