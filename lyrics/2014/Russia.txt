Been looking at the sky
wishing on a star
waiting for a brand new start

Living on the edge
closer to the crime
cross the line a step at a time

Now maybe there's a place
maybe there's a time
maybe there's a day you'll be mine

Now something's got to give
make a brighter day
all we got to say

Shine into my darkness
shine into the night, my rising sun
drive away the madness
Can you be a masterpiece of love
Sending out a message out above
Telling all the world to show some love
No one's gone bring me down, bring me down
You are my rising sun

Keep looking up ahead
riding like a wind
open up your heart, let me in

My life is on a string
when I see you smile
our love will last a thousand miles

Now maybe there's a place
maybe there's a time
maybe there's a day you'll be mine

Now something's got to give
make a brighter day
all we got to say
