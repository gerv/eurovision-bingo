Light, I want to see light
Paint the break of dawn
Live, love
Feel and know that

Today, the sun may not rise
But even if it rains
You and I will dance
No one can stop us

We're dancing in the rain
Dancing in the rain

Life, gets you every time
Open up ,
You never know what you will find
You never know what waits inside

So, live
Like you'll never stop
Take this chance
And give it everything you’ve got
Come on and let the rhythm drop

We're dancing in the rain
Dancing in the rain

Keep on like it's never ending
Keep on till the light of day
Keep on dancing in the rain
The rain, the rain

Let it come down
Let the rain come down
The rain, the rain, the rain

Let it come down
Let the rain come down
The rain, the rain, the rain

The Rain, the rain

Dancing
Dancing
Dancing

Dancing

Let it come down
Let the rain come down

Even if it rains and we get wet
We won’t stop dancing

Keep on dancing in the rain
The rain, the rain
