I don’t know if it’s right
But I’ve got a feeling
And want to believe this is magical
Is this what it’s like
Cause I’m starting to feel it
And want to believe it’s incredible.

If you only knew all the things I could tell you
We could be dancing with stars in the night

It’s so magical, so magical,
So beautiful, So beautiful

It’s a Miracle! It’s a Miracle!
I can see it now!

All the things I see
I think I see them too
All for you and me
It’s like a dream come true
It’s so beautiful
No one will ever know
It’s a miracle

Now you know that I’m right
And you got that feeling
I told you before that it’s magical
Yes it’s magical
Now you know what it’s like
And you’re starting to feel it
And you just can’t deny it’s incredible

If I only knew all the things you could tell me
We could be dancing with stars in the night

It’s a Miracle! It’s a Miracle!
I can see it now!

All the things I see
I think I see them too
All for you and me
It’s like a dream come true
It’s so beautiful
No one will ever know
It’s a miracle
