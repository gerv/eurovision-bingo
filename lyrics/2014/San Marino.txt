Maybe there's a pearl in the shell
Maybe there's a story to tell
Maybe we can not live in peace cos we're under a spell

Maybe there’s a light from above
Maybe there’s a flight of a dove
When it's time
To open the heart of love

Maybe we can try
Maybe you and I
Are finding pain to overcome

Maybe then one day
Every soul heals and will find a way

And maybe
We really are the dream of God
And we woke up in flesh and blood
With our emotion transformed into gold

Or maybe
In certain solid ways I feel
I know there’s nothing stronger and more real
Than falling in love

Maybe you and I
Are tear drops from the sky
That fill the sea eternally

Maybe we can try
To challenge the fear of the endless night

And maybe
We really are the dream of God
And we woke up in flesh and blood
to find our bodies transformed into gold

Or maybe
In certain solid ways I feel
I know there’s nothing stronger and more real
Than falling in love

Maybe it’s a journey in the darkest night
Maybe we can make it to the morning light
Maybe this is it this is real and I feel this is right
Finally right

And maybe
The courage that I'm finding now
Remembering and sensing how
We fell in love
