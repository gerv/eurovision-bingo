Even human bound, people rolling dice.
Image on the ground, such a novel life, he thought,
while knowing nothing at all.
Every option noted or tendency made,
they will carry on until the perfect date, she said,
while knowing nothing at all.

All the rules well known, they mean nothing to me.
Everything I'm used to seems to be
fine misshapen made up fantasy,
should let go, should let go!

But we found something better,
plain answer however,
for I'll not surrender.
We found something better.

Vis-Ã -vis estranged and we got close.
Trust full of lies, sure how it goes, they told,
while knowing nothing at all.
Talking loud 'bout future in our hands.
Exchanging dreams and how they'll last, no no,
still knowing nothing at all.

But we found something better.
plain answer however,
for I'll not surrender.
We found something better.

All these words reflected back to me.
All these words, I'm buying, why?
All these words, the lives grand mystery.
All these words a sweet white lie!
All these words she meant to say to me.
All these words against my faith.
All these words, before she passed away.
All these words, will never never never change.

We found something better.
plain answer however,
for I'll not surrender.
We found something better.
We found!
We found!
We found!
We found, we found, we found, we found! We found!
