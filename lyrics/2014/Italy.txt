I Hate being in a rush,
noises, fog,
this city’s hung time

I hate high heels
Which I absent-minded wedge
Into this city’s intrusive manholes

I hate myself at the mirror
Not for the faults
But just because it’s foolish
I love staying around
Knowing I will always be back
To this city

And please tell me if there’s a meaning to time,
To my useless wandering,
And tell me if there’s really a destination
Or if I’ll need to run to reach my happiness

And I run and run
Back and forth
I run away, I want, I take and shiver
and I hold your breath tight
And I think about myself
With no control
I push hard and I’m not scared of you
I want it all
I want you…I want you, I want you

I love downtown traffic,
I love parking inattentively
Your smile
My instability

I love being in a huff
Without even a reason
And then make up in the evening
Shut down the city

And I love myself for this
For egocentricity
Without rationality.
I love fooling you around
Knowing I will always be back
To my city.

And please tell me if there’s a meaning to time,
To my useless wandering,
And tell me if there’s really a destination
Or if I’ll need to run to reach my happiness

And I run and run
Back and forth
I run away, I want, I take and shiver
and I hold your breath tight
And I think about myself
With no control
I push hard and I’m not scared of you
I want it all
I want you…I want you, I want you

Please tell me if you want it
And tell me you ain’t just a confused reflection
I am looking at on the bottom of ourselves.

And I run and run
Back and forth
I run away, I want, I take and shiver
and I hold your breath tight
And I think about myself
With no control
I push hard and I’m not scared of you
I want it all
I want you…I want you,
I want you, I want you.
