I met this lady - Lady
she was looking so dawn fine
But she was crazy - Crazy
it was all about party time

and lately - Lately
I felt like somethings wrong
So Flaky, and Shaky
When the sun went down

yeah, boom boom boom
when she walked the room
Even girls they whistle - (whistle)
I know, it's hard to get her
She's a special girl

It feels like
skuba duba dabda dididaj
skuba duba dabda dididaj
I love you
A another cliche baby
skuba duba dabda dididaj
skuba duba dabda dididaj
Baby I'ma do whatever you like
I love you
A another Cliche baby

Oh Oh Oh - Hey!
Oh Oh Oh - Hey!
Oh Oh Oh - Hey!
Another Cliche baby

Like Katy Perry - So Sexy
She could kiss a lucky girl
Taste like cherry - Cherry
Yeah, she could rock your world

Cloud Seven - Seven
I never felt like this before
She took me closer, to heaven
OMG, let's go

Yeah, boom boom boom
when she walked the room
Even girls they whistle - (whistle)
I know, we could be together
You're a special girl

It feels like
skuba duba dabda dididaj
skuba duba dabda dididaj
I love you
A another cliché baby
skuba duba dabda dididaj
skuba duba dabda dididaj
Baby I'ma do whatever you like
I love you
A another Cliché baby

Oh Oh Oh - Hey!
Oh Oh Oh - Hey!
Oh Oh Oh - Hey!
Another Cliché baby

Now tell me what I gotta do
Just give that little clue
Another Cliché baby
Now I'm just feeling blue
I gotta break through - To You
YEAH!!!
