When I came to,
your smell on me
i reached around the bed and grabbed a cigarette out of your bag.
Sound of you breathing,
feel of your skin,
brought back some memories,
I never thought this all could happen to me.
Ten hours are missing from memory,
I vaguely can recall pain and pleasure mixing in one bowl
My mind is spinning,
I know the bliss
Ten million miles away my flesh and bones are dreaming in a haze.
Stains of mud on your skin
Night will come and so will the sin
