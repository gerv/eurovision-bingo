Don’t ask me why the sun is shining
Not after the day is done
The evening falls bright
Bring out the best in me, I see

Massive falls weighing down people all around
But they don’t seem to mind at all
And I will try to stand my ground, won’t be bound
Bring out the best in me

What’s the pressure?
You will grow, you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best

Don’t ask me why the sun is shining
It brings me all joy and hope and light
Even though these rules they, they try to take over me
Try to take over me, I see

Massive falls weighing down people all around
But they don’t seem to mind at all
And I will try to stand my ground, won’t be bound
Bring out the best in me

What’s the pressure?
You will grow, you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best

Now what’s the pressure?
This is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best

You gotta do what you wanna do
You gotta be who you wanna be
So tell me, what’s the pressure?

Now what’s the pressure?
‘Cause this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best

Now what’s the pressure?
You will know and you will know in the end
That this is fiction
It’s in your mind, live your life the best
