I’m going nowhere and I’m going fast
I should find a place to go and rest
I should find a place to lay my head tonight

Every morning there’s another start
Every morning hits so hard
Guess I’m running scared guess I’m running on empty

Mister can you help me
‘Cause it seems I’ve been lead astray
I keep searching for an answer for a way
Won’t you help me

You gotta slow down brother
Slow down brother
Slow down if you can’t go on
Slow down brother
Slow down brother
Slow down if you can’t go on

Do you think I’ll ever learn
I used to be without concern
Now all I ever do don’t seem to free me

Mister can you help me
‘Cause it seems I’ve been lead astray
I keep searching for an answer today
Won’t you help me

You gotta slow down brother
Slow down brother
Slow down if you can’t go on
Slow down brother
Slow down brother
Slow down if you can’t go on
