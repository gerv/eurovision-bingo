Here we are together, you and I (I)
Watching lights surround us, feel the night (night)

I was living in the dark
Try to heal my broken heart
Until now
Here we are together you and I (I)

For a thousand years, through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I’ve been waiting for this night, I’ve been waiting for this night

When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I
I’ve been waiting for this night, I’ve been waiting for this night

If only I could stay here by your side (side)
To promise you forever here tonight (night)

There is nothing I can’t do
That can take my heart from you
Always yours
If only I could stay here by your side (side)

For a thousand years, through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I’ve been waiting for this night, I’ve been waiting for this night

When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I
I’ve been waiting for this night, I’ve been waiting for this night

Oh oh oh….

For a thousand years, through a million tears
With a hungry heart, every day apart
I’ve been waiting for this night, I’ve been waiting for this night

When I see your smile and your beautiful eyes
I get lost in time, now I know that I
I’ve been waiting for this night, I’ve been waiting for this night

Here we are together you and I
