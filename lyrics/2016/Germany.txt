The story of us
Is it already told?
Let’s tear the book apart
Start to rewrite it all

We’re already gone
But still in this together
Like a dragon to his gold
We’re still holding on

Our life won’t wait for us to live
We don’t need a lifetime
to figure out what we miss
The love we get is the love we give
A money chest full of love
(But we hid the key)

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We’re lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who’s scared now!

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We’re playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who’s scared now!

Can we get an alternate ending?
Can we get an alternate ending, ooooohoohoh

Somehow we will change
Everything that we touch
But we held on too tight
And changed it too much

We sweep up this love
Put the pieces back together
And if we find them all
Can we bring this to life?

Our life won’t wait for us to live
We don’t need a lifetime
to figure out what we miss
The love we get is the love we give
(A money chest full of love
But we hid the key)

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We’re lonely in a crowded room together
Tell me who’s scared now!

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We’re playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who’s scared now!

Ooooh, OOOOhhhh
(This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We’re lonely in a crowded room together)

Tell me who’s scared now!

This is the ghost of you
Haunting the ghost of me
We’re playing house in these walls forever
Tell me who’s scared now!
