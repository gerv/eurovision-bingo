AHH
AHH

I’ve been fading into grey
Trying to be someone
Trying to please someone

I’ve been painting bitter blue
Always hitting walls
Always trying to break the fall

I’m not perfect
But I’m A ok
Chasing off the clouds
I lock the blues away
I lock the pain away

I can’t get enough of your love
I can’t get you out of my heart
I can’t get enough of your love
’Cause i-i-i-I

Feel like I can walk on water
On water, On water
And now i’m gonna walk on
water, On water, On water
Feels like I can walk on water

I’ve been trying hard to hear
what my heart wants to say
Letting it lead the way

I’m not perfect
But I’m A ok
Chasing off the clouds
I lock the blues away
I lock the pain away

I can’t get enough of your love
I can’t get you out of my heart
I can’t get enough of your love
’Cause i-i-i-I

Feel like I can walk on water
On water , On water
And now i’m gonna walk on

Ooh ooh ooh
All I wanna do is
Ooh ooh ooh
Keep walking on water
Ooh ooh ooh
All I wanna do is
Walk on water

Ooh

I can’t get enough of your love
’Cause i- i-i-I

Feel like I can walk on water
On water, On water
And now i’m gonna walk on
water On water on water
Feel like I can walk on water
