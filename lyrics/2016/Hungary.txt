When you need to run away
From what other people say
Your enemy might be your own mind

A smile, a hug, a little praise
You haven’t received for days
For long you feel mistreated

In a world where the poems sound fake
And the love is replaced by the fame

A million hearts of a million people
Be proud, you were born to be real
A million lies in a million temples
It’s only fear, become a pioneer

You’ve been weird, been a mess
They don’t know how to value uniqueness
So they turn their heads away, away

When there no more products to sell
Everyone will cast their own spell

A million hearts of a million people
Be proud, you were born to be real
A million lies in a million temples
It’s only fear, become a pioneer

No right time, no right place
To meet your inner grace
Approval is found within

A million hearts of a million people
Be proud, you were born to be real
No right time, no right place, yeah
A million lies in a million temples
It’s only fear, become a pioneer

You should know, you should know
Oh, you should know, you should know
