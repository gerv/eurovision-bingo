You and I we collide
Like the stars on the summer night
We can shine forever

And you and I we’re alive
What we feel is what is right
We can run like never

If love was a crime, then we would be criminals
Locked up for life
But I’ll do the time

If love was a crime
Then we would work miracles
High above the ground

Give me the love
They will never break us down
Give me the love
They will never break us down

Never mind
Wrong or right
Our love ain’t got no pride
So we change for better

Unafraid
Never fade
When it’s dark we illuminate
Can we rise together

If love was a crime, then we would be criminals
Locked up for life
But I’ll do the time

If love was a crime
Then we would work miracles
High above the ground

Give me the love
They will never break us down
Give me the love
They will never break us down
Together we’re untouchable

You and me against the world
Together we’re invincible
Together we’re untouchable
You and me against the world
Together we’re invincible
They will never break us down
