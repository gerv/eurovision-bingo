You got in my head, boy, like a song
That I kept on singing, all along
But the radio stopped to play us long ago, long ago

Guess I’ve had enough, boy, guess I’m done
Like a burning fire, now it’s gone
Thought I saw myself in you
I made a mistake,
there’s nothing to say
I’m walking away

Gonna take a miracle, oh oh
Gonna take a miracle to heal this love
Baby I won’t stay another night
This time I say good bye, I’m letting you go

Gonna take a miracle, oh oh

It was a one way road for you and I
Yeah, we built this castle based on lies
And now we have hit the point of no return
We crash and we burn, you live and you learn

Gonna take a miracle, oh oh
Gonna take a miracle to heal this love
Baby I won’t stay another night
This time I say good bye, I’m letting you go

Gonna take a miracle, oh oh
Gonna take a miracle to save us now
And I won’t pretend to be alright
my heart is on the line, our end is my start

Gonna take a miracle, oh oh
Gonna take a miracle to save us now

Gonna take a miracle, oh oh
Gonna take a miracle to save us now
