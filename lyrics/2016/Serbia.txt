I wish I could stop it, wish I could fight it
But there’s nothing I can do, ooh…
I thought that we were meant for each other
Oh, how I wish I knew you better

I played a fool so many times
Can’t even count it

Every time I say goodbye
You try to hold me by your side
Couldn’t fight my way out of your hands
Find a shelter from the pain

Every time you say your lies
I hide away and close my eyes
I won’t let you tear my world apart
Gonna find a shelter for my heart

I thought that it was supposed to hurt me
I thought that it was love, mmm…
I put my hands up but I won’t surrender
Don’t need what doesn’t serve me anymore

I lick my wounds
So that I can keep on fighting

Every time I say goodbye
You try to hold me by your side
Couldn’t fight my way out of your hands
Find a shelter from the pain

Every time you say your lies
I hide away and close my eyes
I won’t let you tear my world apart
Gonna find a shelter for my heart

(Oh… oh…)
Every time I said goodbye
(Oh… oh…)
Baby, stay away this time

Every time I say goodbye
(You try to hold me by your side)
I will fight my way out of your hands
(Find a shelter from the pain)

Every time… (Every time you say your lies)
(I hide away and close my eyes)
Won’t let you tear my world apart
Gonna find a shelter for my heart
