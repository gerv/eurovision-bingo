I know you told so many times
So many words in different rhymes
But I don’t feel the same

I wasn’t innocent, I know
And things I did for sure were wrong
The time has passed so long

Feeling your heartbeat
That’s what I want
That’s what I need
Feeling again that you’re breathing with me

I’m getting wild when I’m alone
I learned by heart you’re not my own
But I never asked you to belong

You’re my desire and my pain
But all battles are in vain
You mean more than anything to me

Feeling your heartbeat
That’s what I want
That’s what I need
Feeling again that you’re breathing with me

Feeling your heartbeat
That’s what I want
That’s what I need
Feeling again that you’re breathing with me

You’re the one that I need
You’re the air that I breathe
Don’t throw my heart away
I want you to stay

Feeling your heartbeat
That’s what I want
That’s what I need
Feeling again that you’re breathing with me

Feeling your heartbeat
That’s what I want
That’s what I need
Feeling again that you’re breathing with me

Feeling your heartbeat
