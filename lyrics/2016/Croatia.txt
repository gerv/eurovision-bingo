Lightning strikes on the sea
Breaking waves around me

Stormy tides and I feel
My ship capsizing

Out of sight – saving shore
Ever gone – evermore

Ropes untied – rain that pours
The waters rising

In devastating times
I keep this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

’cause there is a light
Guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage

There in the sky
Hiding away
Never to die and fade

I know that I’ll find your

Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse

Harbours near
No more fear
Wall of clouds disappears

So I steer to the pier
In tears – arriving

No devastating times
I kept this hope of mine
Even in the darkest night

’cause there is a light
Guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage

There in the sky
Hiding away
Never to die and fade

I know that I’ll find your

Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse

’cause there is a light
Guiding my way
Keeping me safe when oceans rage

There in the sky
Hiding away
Never to die and fade

I know that I’ll find your

Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse
Your lighthouse

I know that I’ll find your
