Waking up alone, like a man that failed … Trapped into the mist of our fairytale And you know, you know, you know, I’m still inside

I knew it all along, but I couldn’t tell … This kind of love, would lock my heart in jail You know, you know, you know, it’s doing time

Caught in the middle of, the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under the spotlight, I howl in the moonlight … Howling for you

Take it on … take it on … and get me through the night Take it on … take it on … until the morning light
Take it on … take it on … and get me through the night Takeiton…takeiton…takeiton

I’ve heard it all before, people always say … Time can take the sorrow and the pain away You know, you know, this love will never die

Caught in the middle of, the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under the spotlight, I howl in the moonlight … Howling for you Caught in the middle of, the dawn and the sunrise
Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
Under the spotlight, I howl in the moonlight … Howling for you

Take it on … take it on … and get me through the night Take it on … take it on … until the morning light
Take it on … take it on … and get me through the night Takeiton…takeiton…takeiton

I cross the oceans, I fly on the skyline … Drive any road that, will bring me by your side

Take it on … take it on … and get me through the night Take it on … take it on … until the morning light
Take it on … take it on … and get me through the night Takeiton…takeiton…takeiton

Caught in the middle of, the dawn and the sunrise Life is a miracle, I saw it in your eyes
