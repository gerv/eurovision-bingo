Heartbeat, when you’re not around its beating slow, and it’s something that I’ve never known..oh oh oh
I’ll be, I’ll be the answer you’ve been waiting for,
I’ll be the truth that you’ve been looking for..oh oh oh

You’re not alone, we’re in this together, all that you want is right here forever, and they dont need to know – they don’t need to know
You’re not alone, we’re in this together, all that you want I’m right here forever, and they don’t need to
know – and they don’t need to know

You’re free, free to let go cause I’ll be here for you, and when you fall I’ll be your parachute –
oh oh oh

I-i-i feel like I’m dancing in the sky, I come alive when I’m with you, I come alive when I’m with you

You’re not alone we’re in this together, all that you want, is right here forever and they don’t need to know – they don’t need to know.

I-i-i feel like I’m dancing in the sky, I come alive when I’m with you, I come alive when I’m with you

Don’t speak, your smile tells me all I need to know, your eyes show me where I want to go – oh

You’re not alone we’re in this together, all that you want, is right here forever and they don’t need to know – they don’t need to know.

I-i-i feel like I’m dancing in the sky, I come alive when I’m with you, I come alive when I’m with you
