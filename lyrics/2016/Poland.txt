When loneliness – is knocking on your door
Everything you loved – just disappears
And when you feel – that everything is lost
You need to know – there’s no life without tears

O -O – O – O – tell me black or white
What color is your life
O – O – O –O – try to ask your heart
Who you really are

No one is – forever beautiful and young
Everything you know – just disappears
Fame and gold are nothing – you can be sure
When there is no love in your heart
The choice is yours – who you really want to be
Don’t be afraid – of your destiny
So when you feel – that everything is lost
You need to know – there’s no life without fear

O -O – O – O – tell me black or white
What color is your life
O – O – O –O – try to ask your heart
Who you really are

Every day – we must fight with the wind
We have to live
All these things are just empty desire
‘Couse ther’s no smoke without fire

O -O – O – O – tell me black or white
What color is your life
O – O – O –O – try to ask your heart
Who you really are

O – O – O –O – try to ask your heart
What color is your life
