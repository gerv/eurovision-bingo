Growing tired and weary brown eyes
Trying to feel your love through face time
Symphonies of dreams and highlights
Caught up in this crazy fast life
But baby you’re not here with me
And I keep calling calling
Keep calling cause

Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence

Getting hard to break through the madness
You’re not here it never makes sense
Tidal waves of tears are crashing
No one here to save me drowning
Cause baby you’re not here with me
And I keep calling calling
Keep calling cause

Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence

I know I’m stronger and I’m capable
I know it’s all in my head
But I keep calling calling
Calling calling

Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
Now my heart awakes to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
And it beats to the sound of silence
