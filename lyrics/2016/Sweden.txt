I’d crawl thru the desert on my hands and knees
rehearsing my pretty please
climb the highest mountain
if I were sorry

Shout it from the top
swim under water until my lungs exploded
walk into the fire
if I were sorry

I’d run a thousand mile
wouldn’t stop until I dropped
wouldnt take a break to breathe until I got close
enough

Then I’d do it all again
if I really had the chance
but I know deep inside for you it’s just another
dance

If I were sorry
I’d give you all the glory
if I were sorry

If I were sorry
it would be a different story

If I were sorry
if I were sorry oh

I’d hold my breath until my face turned blue
I’d rob a bank and the post office too
swim across the ocean
if I were sorry

I’d take wow of silence
I wouldn’t say a single word
until you really heard
if I were sorry

I’d run a thousand miles
wouldn’t stop until I dropped
wouldn’t take the break to breathe
until I got close enough

If I were sorry
I’d give you all the glory
if I were sorry

If I were sorry
it would be a different story
if I were sorry oh

Now did you ever realize
that your mistake had a prize
oh you threw it all away
cuz you’re the devil in disguise

Now would you ever realize
the consequences of your lies
and would you save the falling tear or act as if
there’s nothing there

If I were sorry
if I were sorry

If I were sorry
if I were sorry

If I were sorry
I’d take a vow of silence

I wouldn’t say a single word
if I were sorry

If I were sorry
I’d be on my hands and knees
begging pretty please
if I were sorry
but I’m not sorry no
