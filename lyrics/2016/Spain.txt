Hello hello Mr. fighter
Look! there we go again…
Go-getters don´t forsake!
They never wallow in their fate

More than a thousand miles until the end
We´re never gonna know what lies ahead.
We only got today
to learn from our yesterday!

I feel alive bringing into play
my whole life going all the way.
I´m still alive and I turn away
from broken mirrors.
I feel alive when I dare to say
I wanna fight!
Won´t fix by running…

Say yay yay yay!
Come on and raise your battle cry!
You are the one who never dies!
Hurray! Sing it la la la la!
Go on singing la la la la!
You keep on climbing over hills!
Right now you´re following your dreams!
Hurray! Sing it la la la la! Hurray!

Say Yay Yay Yay!
Hurray!

Hello Hello Mr. Danger
No need to be afraid!
I know by heart my shades
I got the light between my breaks 

More than a thousand
wounds upon my hands
of every time I fought them face to face!
We go through our mistakes
to find the way to go back straight.

I feel alive bringing into play
my whole life going all the way.
I´m still alive and I turn away
from broken mirrors
I feel alive when I dare to say
I wanna fight!
Won´t fix by running!
No won´t fix by running!

Come on and raise your battle cry!
You are the one who never dies!
Hurray! Sing it la la la la!
Go on singing la la la la!
You keep on climbing over hills!
Right now you´re following your dreams!
Hurray! Sing it la la la la! Hurray!
