A language I don’t understand
You speak, I listen, I’m your friend
You hypnotise me, hypnotise me with your hand

A million faces tied and chained
You ride a black horse in the rain
You hypnotise me, hypnotise me

Don’t escape, no more
Stand here and face me
We are all

Made of stars
Look around you, love will find you
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling

We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars

You heal me, you feel me
Ignite a flame within me
You hypnotise me, hypnotise me

Don’t escape no more
Stand here and face me
‘Cause we are all

Made of stars
Look around you, love will find you
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling

We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars

Dance with me like we are made of stars
Dance with me like we are made of stars

Made of stars
Look around you, love will find you
Made of stars
Silver fragments falling

We are made of stars
Searching for that secret promise
Made of stars
