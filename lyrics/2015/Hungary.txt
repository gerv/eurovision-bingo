Do you know our earth is a mess
All the wars for nothing, it never ends
Everybody deserves a chance
All the souls, all the souls, can you hear them cry?

That you live in peace does not mean
It’s okey to ignore all the pain
I see children joining the stars
Soldiers walk towards the dark, let me ask

Can you justify all the eyes
That will never see daylight
Give me one good reason to hurt
A helpless soul, break a heart, kill a mind.

Do you know how many innocents
Are hiding from punishment
For crimes they’d never commit
All alone, all alone, do they deserve

To die for believing something else,
For having a face someone can’t stand
Do you know our earth is a mess
All the wars for nothing, it never ends
All the souls, all alone, hold them tight
All the souls, deserve a chance at life
