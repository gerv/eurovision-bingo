I hold my breath, I´m on the edge
Storming hills, I´ve been lost and found
I hope they're coming, I can hear them running

I once met peace, he said that he
Soon would have the answers to this hurt
And my mind was made up, I would never give up

No I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I'll lose my mind
I won't give up my right, I know every heart deserves a fight

I will beat on the drum, rise above with me
I will go till I'm numb, rise above with me
No I won't sleep tonight

They whine and roar, hungry for more
Yellow glowing eyes, I’m hypnotised
I feel brave yet scared, but I'll stay prepared

Oh have my soul, it’s destined
It’s written in the sky
Let me not be blinded by this hurt
Set him loose I’m ready
For the stars to guide me

No I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I'll lose my mind

No I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I'll lose my mind
I won't give up my right, I know every heart deserves a fight

I will beat on the drum, rise above with me
I will go till I'm numb, rise above with me
No I won't sleep tonight

No I won't sleep tonight
If tomorrow comes I'll lose my mind
I won't give up my right, I know every heart deserves a fight
