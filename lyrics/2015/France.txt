All that remains to me are tears
These few notes that come from long ago
And the song of our prayers
Our hearts that hope
And the emptiness under my steps

All that remains to me are ashes
Of my village plunged into silence
I am but a wound
A heart without an armour
How do I survive after this

But I am here, I don’t forget
In my village swept away by history
And I live here, don’t you forget
Erased from maps and memories

I remember the laughter of children
The voices of men when they left for the field
The harvest festivals
The smell in the houses
The bursts of love and joy

But I am here, I don’t forget
In my village swept away by history

When they arrived
Hidden behind their weapons
They were thousands
They laughed at our tears

They wished to destroy
Our beliefs and our souls
With words of hatred
That we did not know

I am here tonight
In the middle of these ruins
To talk to you about hope
And to sing life
And I swear
When the blood will dry
That I will rebuild my city
More beautiful than before

But don’t forget
