The sky brought you to me,
The sky took you from me,
Still hurts me what used to hurt.
My days are the walls
My nights are the shackles (bonds)
I’m still serving you, my love.

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye.

Rosemary has blossomed, white lily has bent,
Everything smells like sorrow.
I try to forget, not to think of you,
But my heart is still pining for you.

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye.

A,a,a....

I still don’t give you to the mists of the mountains,
I still don’t give you to the depths of the water.
And you ask me to let you go, forever
To sink you into oblivion and say goodbye.
