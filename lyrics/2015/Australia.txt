I don’t want tomorrow
Oh baby tonight’s so good
Tonight’s so good
This is one tough act to follow
Oh baby tonight’s so good
Forget tomorrow
We can do tonight again

Oh Everyone’s got their problems
There’s always something on your mind
Oh but tonight we aint gotta solve them
For now let’s leave them all behind

Do whatchya whatchya whatchya want
Do whatchya whatchya whatchya want
Do whatchya whatchya whatchya want
Oh get on it
Ooh get on it

Oh! Some people might call ya crazy
They say we only live for fun
Ooh They may be right but only maybe
But I can guarantee what we got is what they want
