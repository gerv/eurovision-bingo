I close my eyes and think of her
The sweet scent of her skin
It’s a voice within that is bringing me where the sun arises
Lonely are the words
But if they go written everything can change
With no fear anymore I want to scream this great love
Love, just love, it’s what I feel...
Tell me why when I think, I only think of you
Tell me why when I see, I only see you
Tell me why when I believe, I believe in you... great love
Tell me that never
That you’ll never leave me
Tell me who you are
Breath of the love days of mine
Tell me that you know
That you’ll only choose me
Now you know it
You’re my unique great love...

Tell me why when I think, I only think of you
Tell me why when I love, I only love you
Tell me why when I live, I live inside you... great love
Tell me that never
That you’ll never leave me
Tell me who you are
Breath of the love days of mine
Tell me that you know
That I would never make a mistake
Tell me that you are
You’re my unique great love...
