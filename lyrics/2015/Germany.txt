When you look at me, you know you're hard to read.
Because the face I see is not the one I know
And when you call me baby, what's that supposed to mean
I don't know who you are, how long can we pretend

See the change I know we both don't have the heart to say
Can't return to what we were, it will never be the same

Cause you said you'd never let me go
And I said I can't but now we know that it's
Too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work
When there's nothing left to talk about
Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn
Do you know, we're only left with smoke

Black smoke, we're only left with smoke, black smoke

I tried to tell myself, that it's all in my head
But the truth remains we're just too far apart.
You know were fooling ourselves if we hold on,
Cause were fighting for something that we donâ€™t want
Just leave it now and walk away

See the change I know we both don't have the heart to say
Can't return to what we were, it will never be the same

Cause you said you'd never let me go
And I said I can't but now we know that its
Too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work
When there's nothing left to talk about
Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn
Do you know, we're only left with smoke

Too hard to say three words
Black smoke
Too hard to make it work
We're only left with smoke
Too hard to say three words
Black smoke
Too hard to make it work

Cause you said you'd never let me go no
Yeah you said you'd never let me go

Cause you said you'd never let me go
And I said I can't but now we know that it's
Too hard to say three words
Too hard to make it work
When there's nothing left to talk about
Cause you know the flame is running out
Two hearts are left to burn
Do you know, we're only left with smoke

Black smoke
We're only left with smoke
