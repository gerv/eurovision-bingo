Every time you’re brokenhearted
Sinking in the sorrow
Feel the emptiness and have no faith
No strength to breathe

I wanna tell you
It’s gonna be better
You've got the greatness within you

Beyond the fear
Let’s build the bridge
From heart to heart
In the name of love

Every time you struggle with the fear about tomorrow
Call the angels for their guidance
Find the other way

I wanna tell you
It’s gonna be better
You've got the greatness within you

Beyond the fear
Let’s build the bridge
From heart to heart
In the name of love

Beyond the fear
Let’s build the bridge
From heart to heart
In the name of love (x4)
