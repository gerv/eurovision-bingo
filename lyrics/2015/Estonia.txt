I woke up at 6 a.m.
my eyes were closed but my mind was awake
pretended I was breathing in a deep sleep pace

got dressed so quietly
I was frozen by the jingle of my keys at the door
as I got outside I smiled to the dog

I didn’t wanna wake you up
my love was never gonna be enough
so I took my things and got out of your way now girl

why didn’t you wake me up
I’m pretty sure i would have told you to stop
lets try again and say goodbye
goodbye to yesterday

why would you think like that
yeah we fight a lot but in the end
you and I we’re a perfect match

I wouldn’t want it any other way
but now you're gone and I’m all alone
lying here naked and staring at the phone
