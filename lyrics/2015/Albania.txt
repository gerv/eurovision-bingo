I was too afraid right from the start
To even let you, welcome you in my heart
You cut it deep and left it bleeding hard
Will i ever heal these painful scars?

I just can't help it
I'm out of breath, I'm try and find the words to say
Time pass' by
Now its broad daylight

I know you'll come
With the speed of light
You're my everything , all that I need.
You shut down my dreams
But I’m not gonna cry
You live within me, that’s why I’m alive
I am alive
Cuz you are my life,
You are my sun,
I am alive, cuz you are my life.

Your name is printed crystal clear on glass..
From all the sighs, coming out' my breath
I'm blinded by,
This love can't stop screaming out your name so loud
Where are you at?
Baby won't you come back?

I know you'll come
With the speed of light
You're my everything , all that I need.
You shut down my dreams
But I’m not gonna cry
You live within me, that’s why I’m alive
I am alive
Cuz you are my life,
You are my sun,
I am alive, cuz you are my life.
