Fighter
Oximated
World's gonna get up and see

I'm a warrior
isolated
World's gonna listen to me

Violence
Set it free
Wings are gonna spread up

I'm a warrior
isolated
World's gonna get up and see

woohoo

I'm a warrior
still stuck in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no

woohoo

I'm a warrior
still stuck in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No

Not a shabby
Or a money maker
World's gonna light up in peace

Not in shadows
Bright a little
Not your fault you're just gonna breathe

Violence
Break me free
Wings are gonna spread up
I'm a warrior
Oximated
I'm gonna get up and be

woohoo
I'm a warrior
still stuck in my mind
I've been in danger for too long
No no no
