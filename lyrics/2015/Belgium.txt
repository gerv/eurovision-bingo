Listen to the sound of thunder
Rolling in the soul down under
Far beneath the skin, it rumbles
Step to the step of the drum that rolls inside
Be you enemy or lover
We are put here to discover
The heart that beats within each other
We gonna rapppabab tonight


And if we die , tomorrow
What’ll we have to show
For the wicked ways
Down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On a cosmic track, love attack
I‘m gonna get that rhythm back


Be you enemy or brother
We were put here to discover
The heart that beats within each other
We’re gonna rompanpan ...


And if we die, tomorrow
What’ll we have to show
For the wicked ways
Down below
The rhythm inside is telling us
We can fly tomorrow
On the beautiful wind that blows
On a cosmic track, love attack
I‘m gonna get that rhythm back
