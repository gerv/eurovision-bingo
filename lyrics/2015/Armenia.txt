We find so many ways fooling our heart
Playing too many games trying to hide
When you follow a dream, surrender the sorrow inside
Face every shadow you denied

Feels like so many times life was unfair
Will you run and forget all the despair?
If it’s breaking you down, remember the power inside
Face every shadow you denied

Time is ticking and you keep thinking that you are tricking your heart, so

Don’t deny
Ever don’t deny
Baby don’t deny
You and I

Cross the ocean of blues, happy you'll be
Оnce you’ve risen you are meant to be free
When you're feeling afraid remember there's hope inside
Face every shadow purified

Time is ticking and you keep thinking that you are tricking your heart,so

Don’t deny
Ever don’t deny
Listen don’t deny (I don’t want to deny)
You and I

Don’t deny
Ever don’t deny
Listen don’t deny
Don't deny you and I
