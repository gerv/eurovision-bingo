Anytime that you’re thinking of me
That you might want me
I’ll come on over
Don’t you know
Anytime, anyplace I am yours

You’re a lesson that I love learning
So any time that you’ve got a yearning
Don’t you know
Anytime, anyplace I am yours

You’re what I belong to
The one thing that feels true
Everything I could ever want
If you ever need me
I’m waiting on you
To walk right through that door
Anytime, anyplace I am yours

If you're hoping for second chances of
Stolen kisses I got the answer
Don’t you know
Anytime, anyplace I am yours

You’re what I belong to
The one thing that feels true
Everything I could ever want
If you ever need me
I’m waiting on you
To walk right through that door
Anytime, anyplace I am yours

Uhhh

You’re what I belong to
The one thing that feels true
Everything I could ever want
If you ever need me
I’m waiting on you
To walk right through that door
Anytime, anyplace I am yours

Anytime, anyplace I am yours
