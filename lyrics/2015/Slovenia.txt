When you're down down low
And there's no place you can go...
When you're down down low
You know that I am here for you...

You came into my life when I was broken
You heated up my heart when it was frozen
And we got the flow
Now it's up we go

And now thast it's your turn you wanna hide it
A million times already you've denied it
You don't have to fear
You don't have to fight

When you're down down low
Sinking in the undertow
When you're down down low
You know that I am here for you

Cause I know know baby
All the hurt you never show
When you're down down low
You gotta let me heal your aching soul

You came into my life when I was broken
You heated up my heart when it was frozen
And we got the flow
Now it's up we go

Cause you released my pain now let me take it
Just leave it at the door and we can make it
You don't have to hide
I am by your side

Everybody else sees in black and white
You look at wrong and make it right
Can't I open your eyes

When you're down down low...
