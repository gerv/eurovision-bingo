Honey, I'm telling the truth
I did something terrible in my early youth
My mind went blank, I lost control
I was just a little boy, I did not know
I better let you go...

To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me
Honey, what am I to you
Now I have pulled the trigger on this awful truth
Oh hold me now, cause I'm burning up
Sing me something beautiful, just make it stop
I better let you go...

To find the prince you thought you found in me
I better set you free and give you up
Just wave and say goodbye and let you live
Without a monster like me
