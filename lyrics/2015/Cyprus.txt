Tonight the rain is falling
I’m feeling cold, and I’m
Out of my mind, without you
My head is spinning like a top
Back to the time we had a lot...going on
Now my world lies shattered
How quickly life can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

One day you think you have it all
The next you’re staring at the wall...in a dream
The road that once was paved with gold
Has turned a rusty shade
Of all the saddest colours in the world
Now my life’s in tatters
How quickly it all can change

I always did everything for you
I gave you my heart, you gave me yours too
You’d make me feel I was really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there for you
I should have been there

I didn’t do everything for you
But I tried so hard and that’s the truth
I’d make you feel you were really someone
But there’s one thing I should have done

I nearly did everything for you
But I broke your heart, now mine’s broken too
In your hour of need, I didn’t come...
That’s the one thing I should...have done
