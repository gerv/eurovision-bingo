Well, don’t get on the wrong train
Don’t fly in an old plane
Don’t go out in the pouring rain
You might get wet I’d be upset

You’re bound to get sneezes
Or nasty diseases
Take good care when I’m not there
I’m still in love with you

While I’m on vacation
You be a good patient
Take your medication
I worry so each time I go

Try to keep warm, dear
In case there’s a storm, dear
Take good care while I’m not there
I’m still in love with you

Some younger guys with roving eyes may tantalise you with their lies
You must be wise and realise, leave well alone till you get home, dear

Won’t see other fellas, don’t wanna make you jealous
No need to fear when you’re not here, I’m still in love with you

Instrumental

Let’s dance, dance
Dance

Don’t walk on the red light
Don’t stay out at midnight
Don’t get in a fist fight, that pretty face can’t be replaced…

Won’t be out at night, hon
It wouldn’t be right hon
No need to fear when you’re not here, I’m still in love with you

(Oh yes)

Instrumental

Everybody dance
Everybody dance

Everybody dance
Everybody dance

Skiddy-beep-bop-doo...
Dee-dee-dee

Sounding good, sugar

Skiddy-beep-bop-doo...
Dee-dee-dee

You take care now, honey

Don’t make a fuss, you need to trust me
This is how it always must be
When I stop to think of us, I can assure you, I adore you

Because you’re so gorgeous
You need to be cautious
Take good care when I’m not there, I’m still in love with you

You have a fun time,
And soak up that sunshine
But don’t drink too much wine,
Just one or two will have to do

I know what you’re thinking
So I won’t be drinking
No need to fear when you’re not here, I’m still in love with you

I’m still in love with you

I’m still in love with you
