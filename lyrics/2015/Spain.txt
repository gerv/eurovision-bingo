He left without knowing
That I did love him
He left without believing me

I lost my mind
I bled so much love
Now a vast emptiness lives in me
It all brings me back to you
EEEieEEO
EEEieEEO
My heart
Whispered to me
Don’t you come back without him
On my way to yesterday
Wherever he may be
I challenge oblivion

He left without knowing
I never surrender
EEEieEEO
EEEieEEO
My heart
Whispered to me
Don’t you come back without him

EEEieEEO
EEEieEEO

It whispered
Breathe my soul back into me
Bring me back to
The Break of Day

You’re coming back with me
