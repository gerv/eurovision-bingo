This time, I think I’m falling in love
This time, you’re sent from heaven above
Oh oh oh
My God, stop for a minute and think
How ‘bout we just go out for a drink
Oh oh oh
‘Cos every time I close my eyes
I feel you near

I’m feeling love, love, love
Round and round and round and round and round we go
I’m feeling love, love, love
Round and round and round and round and right in my heart

This time, I hope you don’t mind
I’ll help you put your troubles behind
Oh oh oh
I know there’s a reason for this
One kiss, and you will see what you've missed
Oh oh oh

I’m feeling love, love, love
Round and round and round and round and round we go
I’m feeling love, love, love
Round and round and round and round and right in my heart

Is this how it goes?
I don’t know...
