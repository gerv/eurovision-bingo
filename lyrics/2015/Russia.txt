We are the worlds people
Different yet we're the same
We believe
We believe in a dream

Praying for peace and healing
I hope we can start again
We believe
We believe in a dream

So if you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine

Chorus:
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun
A million voices

Now as the world is listening
From cities and satellites
We believe
We believe
In a dream

If you ever feel love is fading
Together like the stars in the sky
We can sing
We can shine

Chorus:
When you hear our voices call
You won't be lonely anymore
A million voices
Your heart is like a beating drum
Burning brighter than the sun

Bridge:
When I look around at these faces
I can see the stars in the sky
We will sing
We will shine

Singing out
Singing out
ooh
Singing out
Singing out
ooh
Singing out
A million voices
