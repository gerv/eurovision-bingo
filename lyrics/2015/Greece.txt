My soul, I guess I’m just no one
you killed me and I am done, without a gun
my light has fade, I feel betrayed
just can’t be brave, without faith
How could you leave?

I’m begging you take me
wherever you have gone
come back and save me
don’t want to be alone
nothing left, I just have
one last breath

I’ m begging you take me
out of this firing hell
come back and save me
what happened wasn’t fair
nothing left all that I have
is one last breath
only one last breath

Just pain, fake love and drunken lie
Ι struggle to survive, I’m still alive
I’m fighting tears and fears apart
but still it’s dark, inside my heart
