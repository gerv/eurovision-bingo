Mama, someone broke my heart again
Tell her I don't think I can take it anymore
Mama, someone broke my heart again
Now I'm gonna ease my pain,
Dancing on the floor

Take me out,
I'm not in the mood for a broken heart
Gonna dance tonight, forget her
No, she doesnâ€™t know
What I'm doing on the floor
Did you say hello, my ladies?

Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger
Love, Love, Love
Let the rhythm take us higher
You know when I'm on fire
Check me out (3-2-1- hey!)

I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun
Let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
And before I leave
Let me show you Tel Aviv

Hold me tight,
We're not going home tonight
Oh yeah, do you like my dancing?
Pull me baby, I'm your trigger
You know that my love is bigger
Check me out (3-2-1- hey!)

I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
I'm the king of fun
Let me show you how we do it
I'm a golden boy
Come here to enjoy
And before I leave
Let me show you Tel Aviv

This is how we do it...
