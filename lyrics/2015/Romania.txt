If my life was like a song
Happy, sad, not right or wrong
It would be all in the words...there
Swim a river’s length to be
Won’t stop till I reach the sea
Sooner or later I’ll get there
I swear
Life is not a rehearsal, don’t look back
You may lose what you dream
You can’t pause a decision, or change track,
When you don’t know what you mean.

If the stars tomorrow, no longer shine on us,
If a strong wind takes me, and I will turn to dust,
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start,
To start all over again.
If the sky clouds over, with darkness never gone,
If the sun stays hidden, not waking in the dawn,
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start,
To start all over again.

I would run through the night in the darkness
You are my sunshine that I seek
No one can stop my heart being restless
Hear it in the words I speak.

If the stars tomorrow, no longer shine on us,
If a strong wind takes me, and I will turn to dust,
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start,
To start all over again.
If the sky clouds over, with darkness never gone,
If the sun stays hidden, not waking in the dawn,
You will be the reason, you will be the reason to start,
To start all over again.
To start all over again.
To start all over again.
To start all over again.
To start all over again.
