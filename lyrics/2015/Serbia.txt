In a shadowy world lived a dazzling girl
Unaware of the light she’d imprisoned inside.
Took a million mistakes to lead her to daybreak,
But she made it through, now I know the truth!

Beauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn!
Beauty never lies, no, it cries “Here I am!”
Finally I can say , yes, I’m diff’rent, and it’s okay!
Here I am!

Had to shatter the fears laughing in the mirror
Undermining me, now at last I see!

Beauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn!
Beauty never lies, no, it cries “Here I am!”
Finally I can say , yes, I’m diff’rent, and it’s okay!
Here I am!

Beneath the veil of skin the heart’s entangled in,
Beauty’s embodied!
Beneath the mask of shame, my soul is set aflame!


Beauty never lies, never hides, never gives a damn!
Beauty never lies, no, it cries “Here I am!”
Finally I can say , yes, I’m diff’rent, and it’s okay!
Here I am! Here I am!
