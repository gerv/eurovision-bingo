You bring
The light
To
My darkest side, babe

The day
The night
Split
To cure the sight, Oh...

You care
You animate
You guard me bare
Bring up the heart rate

Your love
Revives my soul
And I know
You'll choose it whole
Overall

Your eye’s a good mirror
Look under the cover
Love
Is above all

I’m safe
Into your hands.
Let’s move away
The edges expand

Show me the source of the light
I’m becoming affected
Seeing the glow of a white
Is what I have detected

Feeling again I’m alive
It’s your shining reflected
Love injected, love injected
