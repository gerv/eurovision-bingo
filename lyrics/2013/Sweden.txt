Hey, do you remember
How we would stay up all night
Talking 'bout our destiny
And I played the piano
And you would strum on your guitar
Those were the days
If only you could see me now
I live my dream
I owe it all to you
I owe it to you

Isn't it crazy
Isn't it crazy
It's all because of you
All because of you

It's all because of you
All because of you
I know that if the sky would fall
I'd survive it all because of you

I reach for the horizon
Whenever I've got days of doubt
bringing me down
So even if disaster strikes I close my eyes and then I'm next to you
I'm right there with you

Isn't it crazy
Isn't it crazy
It's all because of you
All because of you

It's all because of you
All because of you
I know that if the sky would fall
I'd survive it all because of you
