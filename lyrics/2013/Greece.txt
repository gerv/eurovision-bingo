Caught in a sea storm on Egnatia street,
Gales are drifting us far from the shore,
Our route might be wrong,
Lights are blinking on and off,
The ship is heading towards Grevena.

In an endless sea of good old whiskey
Castaways are we, not to be found,
The earth is dizzy, it staggers away
Holes in the head and a car that goes round
Who gave it sail and wheel?

Alcohol is free…

Waves are huge, the winds keep on blowing
And the mermaid keeps on asking,
Good woman, Alex had one too many.
Amidst the sea a traffic light,
Perhaps they got whiff of us,
Who put such distance between my house and me?

Chorus (twice)

Caught in a sea storm on Egnatia street
Gales are drifting us too far from the shore
Our route might be wrong
Lights are blinking on and off
The ship is headed towards Grevena.

It’s not the fault of good old whiskey
The ice cubes were spiked
And the ship seems to run on four round wheels!
An alcohol test and a traffic cop
Is of no terror for us
A downhill within the sea begins.

Alcohol is free…
