Who's the one that starts a war?
Who's dictating what is less and more?
Who can change the night and day?
Who's the one with clever face?
That can tell us what is in the space?
Playing games that none can play.

Maybe someday we'll break the wall.
Maybe the light will touch us all.

Chorus :

Lonely planet!
Who has done it?
Who can save you?
Who can stop it?

Who's the one that has the right?
Treat us wrong and tell us what is right?
Bringing crowd against the squad…
Who has honesty to show?
Who can tell us “I don't know” ?
Who's the man and who's the god?

Maybe someday we'll break the wall.
Maybe the light will touch us all.

Chorus :

Lonely planet!
Who has done it?
Who can save you?
Who can stop it?
Lonely planet!
We have done it!
We can save you?

We can stop it.
We can stop it…
We can stop it….
We can stop it…
For the world.
