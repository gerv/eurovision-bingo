Heroes say

When the game gets tough

It’s time to play

Bless them when, though

They mistake offenses for good acts

Happens to us too

To make war and then long for peace

And then in my silence

I annihilate your every single pain

And now I appreciate

What I wasn’t able to choose



As the world falls into pieces

I craft new spaces and needs

That belong to you too

You, whom I believe to be the ESSENTIAL



I won’t accept another

Wrong decision

Love can hide behind loving words

That I uttered before

they turned empty and vain



As the world falls into pieces

I craft new spaces and needs

That belong to you too

As the world falls into pieces

I move away from excesses

And bad habits

To go back to the origins



Going back to you

You, whom I believe to be the ESSENTIAL

Love won’t abide any rules

It takes your breath away

and quenches your thirst



As the world falls into pieces

I craft new spaces and needs

That belong to you too

As the world falls into pieces

I move away from excesses

And bad habits

To go back to the origins

To go back to you, whom I believe to be the ESSENTIAL
