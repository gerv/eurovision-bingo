All our lives
We’ve been afraid
Watching the world decline
Till nothing remains
But in our darkness hour
Right before the dawn
The old world dies
The new day is born

We’re gonna live like it’s our last night alive
And we’re dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun don’t rise
In the end only love survives
So be love
Be love
Just be love (just be love),
Only love (only love)
We are love (we are love),
Only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned
You got to make love your state of
Mind ‘cause in the end
Only love survives
So let the world collide
Don’t be afraid
If it’s the end of time
Love will remain
To live like it’s the last night alive
And we’re dancing till the morning light
And even if the sun don’t rise
In the end only love survives

So be love,
Be love
Just be love (just be love),
Only love (only love)
We are love (we are love),
Only love (only love)
And when the stars are aligned
You got to make love your state of mind
Cause in the end only love survives
So be love (be love)
Only love love love
So make love(be love)
Only love love love
Cause in the end only love survives
