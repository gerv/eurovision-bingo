So the arrow shot right through her heart and rocked her to the core
And she fell so deep like she had never fell so deep before
But the pain was almost unbelievable
When the end was near, she felt the fear alive

Waiting for the bitter pill
Give me something i can feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill
Something i can truly feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and again

‘Cos he didn’t fight for life when he was up against the wall
And he felt so scared for both of them even though they had it all
There’s a lesson that you always have to learn
Through the consequence of fire comes the burn

Waiting for the bitter pill
Give me something i can feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill
Something i can truly feel
‘Cos love kills over and over
Love kills over and again

One last, one last, one last breath for life
Won’t you give me, give me hope tonight

Waiting for the bitter pill
Give me something i can feel
Love kills over and over
Love kills over and over
Waiting for the bitter pill
Something i can truly feel
'Cos love kills over and over
And love kills over and again
Love kills over and over
And love kills over and again
Love kills over and over
And love kills over and again
