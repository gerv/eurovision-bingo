say did you know she's raised by wolves
did you know she dances with dandelions then
gently her head declines
the one for me - she is the one for me
she's the one for me
say did you know she reaches around the globe
she plunges into the deep sea
dancing up on top of clouds
the one for me - she is the one for me

cuz I've got, nothing now
just the one for me - just the one for me
she's all around
so lovely - so lovely
and I'm so glad I found
the one for me - the one for me
I'll sing it loud
she's all I need - she's all I need
right now

see the one for me has riddled dreams and
As she wakes in the morning,
winds will weave her hair at dawn and this I swear
I know she is the one for me - she is the one for me
see the one for me, she challenges
the universe and never shows fear
she will build a carriage out of rosemaries
while crickets sing this song for me
oh she's the one for me

cuz I've got, nothing now
just the one for me - just the one for me
she's all around
so lovely - so lovely
and I'm so glad I found
the one for me - the one for me
I'll sing it loud
she's all I need - she's all I need
I got
nothing now
just the one for me - just the one for me
she's all around
so lovely - so lovely
and I'm so glad I found
the one for me - the one for me
I'll sing it loud
she's all I need - she's all I need
right now
