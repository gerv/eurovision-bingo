Friday night was going nowhere…
Sitting in a small café,
Feeling lonely, a little tired,
I’ve been working hard all day.

Then a noise caught my attention,
And I heard a wonderful sound;
Coming at me like a tsunami,
Nearly took my feet off the ground.

A rush of excitement flowed into my ears.
Oh, beautiful people, ah ha-hi ha-hi-ha!
Hi-ia-ia-ia!

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha.
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night.

Situation started improving.
Maybe this was kismet now.
And my body started moving,
I was really shaking down.

Something happened when I was dancing,
I could feel that powerful beat,
Taking me to new dimensions,
Waking up the devil in me.

A heavenly chorus and love all around.
Oh, beautiful people, ah ha-hi ha-hi-ha!
Hi-ia-ia-ia!

Solayoh, Solayoh, where the sun is always shining on ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha.
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night.

It feels like I'm dreaming, this word makes no sense.
Let's sing it again now, “Ah ha-i!”

Solayoh, Solayoh where the sun is always shining on ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh to the rhythm of a cha-cha.
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night.
Solayoh, Solayoh, turn the music up, it's gonna get ya.
We play-oh, we play-oh, we can make it into a hot night.
We can make it into cha-cha!
