There's no me without you
Don't know what I would do
You're my heartbeat, I'm breathing because of you

There's no world without us
Dreams would turn into dust
You're the reason, the reason I make it through

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
You're love is pouring down on me, you're my
Waterfall

In a moment like this
I'm in a state of bliss
I'm swept away, I look into an open sky

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
You're love is pouring down on me, you're my
Waterfall

My heart is higher than the highest kite
I feel how all your love surrounds me
standing in a waterfall

Feels like I'm flying, like if I had wings
Like I am sailing on a sea of dreams
Your love is pouring like a waterfall
Over me, waterfall
