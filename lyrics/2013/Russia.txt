What if I could change the path of time
What if I had the power to decide
What if I could make us unify

If I
If I

What if we would open up the doors
What if we could help each other more
What if i could make you all believe

If we
If we


What if we all
Opened our arms

What if we
Came together as one

What if we aimed
To stop the alarms

What if we chose to
Bury our guns

Why don’t we always
Reach out to those

Who need us the most

Together we can change the path of time
Together we have power to decide
The answer lies within our hearts and minds

Together
Together

Together we can make a better place
On this little island out in space
Together we can change the world forever

Let’s unite and make a change
Let’s unite and write a new page
Come on sinners come on saints
Have faith
