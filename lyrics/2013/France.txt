You knocked me out from the start
At the end of the day I kind of liked it :
Hands of silk and leather ties….

Where and whom do you hurt
Till you make dawn blush….?
You cast me off like a spell

I'm gonna give you hell
Right where you're loosing yourself
Have a good look in the rear mirror
I 'll be the one standing behind you

You made me cry with burning tears
My neck still carries your brand
Skin to skin , fear to fear …

"No limits " that's a classic
our love was first name for toxic
but beauty justifies it all…

I'm gonna give you hell
Right where you're loosing yourself
Have a good look in the rear mirror
I 'll be the one standing behind you

I'm gonna give you hell
'till you're out of breath
unless, unless..
two becomes our odd number again
unless..
we see our battles fall into oblivion
