I set out upon that long journey
I walked on lost and restless
Didn't think about anything until the following day.
I chose peace and tranquility.
I am alive, I am alive
I glide above every hardship
I am alive, I am alive
When the winds turn against me

I climb over the high mountains
I am alive, I am alive
I didn't understand about love, which can move everything
Didn't dare to embrace and to simply exist
I felt like I didn't deserve to open up my mind
And let the bright love enter within

I am alive, I am alive
I glide above every hardship
I am alive, I am alive
When the winds turn against me
I climb over the high mountains
I'm alive, I'm alive because of you

And I believe it
Yes I do believe it

Perhaps the wondrous gates of heaven will open
Beautiful love will flood out
to embrace me alone
I'm alive, I'm alive
I glide over every difficulty
I am alive, I am alive

When the winds turn against me
I climb over the high mountains
I am alive, I am alive because of you
I am alive, I am alive, I am alive
