The sky is red tonight
we're on the edge tonight
no shooting star to guide us

Eye for an eye
why tear each other apart
please tell me why
why do we make it so hard
look at us now
we only got ourselves to blame
it’s such a shame

How many times can we win and lose
how many times can we break the rules
between us
only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight
how many times till we get it right
between us
only teardrops

So come and face me now
here on the stage tonight
let’s leave the past behind us

Eye for an eye
why tear each other apart
please tell me why
why do we make it so hard
look at us now
we only got ourselves to blame
it’s such a shame - tell me

How many times can we win and lose
how many times can we break the rules
between us
only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight
how many times till we get it right
between us
only teardrops

What’s gone between us
has come between us
only teardrops
What’s gone between us
has come between us

How many times..
