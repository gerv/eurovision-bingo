You say you don't believe in signs from up above
And you laugh at the thought of putting your faith in stuff like love
You never see the rainbow you just curse the rain
You say you wont believe
But it's just not worth the pain today

That's all fine if that's how you want it to be
But if you're feeling alone and afraid and you can't breathe

Believe in me yeah
Believe in me yeah
Believe in
The way I look at you
And stand beside you
The way I speak the truth
I'd never lie to you
If you just believe in the things that your eyes can see
Believe in me

You come and you go when there's never no compromise that's why
The seconds and the minutes of the days of your life
Go crawling by

That's all fine it that's how you want it to be
But you're feeling along and afraid and you can't breathe

Believe in me yeah
Believe in
The way I look at you
And stand beside you
The way I speak the truth
I'd never lie to you
If you just believe in the things that your eyes can see
Believe in me

What-cha gonna do when your ship is sinking
And your crying out for help
And just a segull's listening
In the dark of the night in the middle of the fight
When you're reaching out for something and there's nothing

Believe in me yeah
Believe in me
The way I look at you
And stand beside you
The way I speak the truth
I'd never lie to you
If you just believe in the things that your eyes can see
Believe in me \
