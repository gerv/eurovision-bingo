I still remember
That feeling, so overwhelming, settling on my soul
And yet I'm standing on the road
Searching my heart, battered by the wind
And I know, I know
That things can get better
Every door that closes eventually opens again

The ice will melt and the bare trees will burst into leaf
Every ending is just a new beginning
We need the night so the day can bring us light
For things to start anew
Leave what's passed in the past
For things to once again start anew

The curtain is being raised once more
The second act is starting, where I pick myself up and dust myself down
The same person, only with a different game to play
What lies ahead has changed, I'm taking a different path
And I know, I know
That things can get better
Every door that closes eventually opens again

The ice will melt and the bare trees will burst into leaf
Every ending is just a new beginning
We need the night so the day can bring us light
For things to start anew
Leave what's passed in the past

The ice will melt and the bare trees will burst into leaf
Every ending is just a new beginning
We need the night so the day can bring us light
For things to start anew
Leave what's passed in the past
For things to once again start anew
