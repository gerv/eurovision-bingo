Do you know
It's time to let yourself go
Why don't we just let it show
Tell me what you're waiting for
Tonight we can be
Glorious
We are young at heart and we're free
The world is ours
I can feel the music in me
Glorious
Found a love that eyes cannot see
Delirious
I believe
The little child inside of me
Can rebuild my destiny
And one day i'll be breaking free
Tonight we can be
Glorious
We are young at heart and we're free
The world is ours
I can feel the music in me
Glorious
Found a love that eyes cannot see
Delirious
I can feel the music in me
Found a love that eyes cannot see
We are glorious
We are glorious
We are glorious
We are glorious
Tonight we can be
Glorious
We are young at heart and we're free
The world is ours
I can feel the music in me
Glorious
Found a love that eyes cannot see
Delirious
