Spying on you undercover
Drinking coffee with your mother
Am I getting closer?

Baby I feel like a sinner
Skipping dinner to get thinner
Where is my proposal?

I’m your slave and you’re my master
Oh, baby come on take a shot!

Marry me, I’ll be your Queen Bee
I’ll love you endlessly
I’ll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah I’ll do it for you
Marry me baby!

I’ll play your game, I’ll change my last name
I’ll walk the walk of shame
I’ll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah, I do it for you
Marry me baby!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ding dong!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ding dong!

I know where the future’s heading
I can see my perfect wedding
Isn’t that just bracing?

I don’t think there are no ladies
Who will give you cuter babies
Isn’t that amazing?

I’m your slave and your my master
Oh, baby come on take a shot!

Marry me, I’ll be your Queen Bee
I’ll love you endlessly
I’ll do it for you, for you, for you
Yeah I’ll do it for you.

This is the day
I don’t wanna wait much longer now
If you run away
I’m gonna find you anyhow!

What you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting, what you waiting for?!
