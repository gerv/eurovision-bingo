Should have seen it coming when I saw you
Should have had the sense to stop and walk away
It was gonna turn out complicated
We´ve hit overload about to explode

If love was a mountain
I´d climb up to the highest of them all
I´d swim across the ocean if you´d call
I´m lost in your smile
Freefalling for miles

Hold me
Just unfold me
Unchain my soul
Give me love make me whole
Hold me
If it´s only
For this moment in time
Now I´m yours and your mine
So Hold me

Take a little time then you´ll know better
Than to think about giving in on the one you love
Can we go back and freeze the moment
Where we used to be free was only you and me

Hold me
Just unfold me
Unchain my soul
Give me love make me whole
Hold me
If it´s only
For this moment in time
Now I´m yours and your mine
So Hold me
Hold me

Remember how we used to laugh
But now you´re running from the past
Let´s find a way to carry on
Remember how love used to be
You said I was your fantasy
Can´t take another night alone
so come on home

Hold me
Just unfold me
Unchain my soul
Give me love make me whole
Hold me
If it´s only
For this moment in time
Now I´m yours and your mine
So Hold me
Hold me – Hold me…
