I have to tell you something
It’s been on my mind so long
I’ve got to tell you this
It’s been on my mind way too long
I promised myself to tell
Instead I’m falling apart to see you here

If you don’t know I’m in love with you
When summertime falls It becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I’m wearing today
One is called Love the other is Pain

So tell me now
I’m in your head I’m in your heart tell me now
Tell me now because I’m falling apart to see you here

If you don’t know I’m in love with you
When summertime falls It becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I’m wearing today
One is called Love, the other is Pain

But still you don’t know I’m in love with you
When summertime falls It becomes untrue
Because of my shoes I’m wearing today

One is called Love, the other is Pain
One is called Love, the other is Pain
