A million sunsets are lost in the ocean, lost in our minds;
Your beautiful smile woke me up in the mornings a million times;
A million hopes were revealed in discretion, at shooting stars;
And we didn’t care that I was from Venus, and you were from Mars

Chorus:
I would give you my love, but it wasn’t enough for us to make it last;
The Maya were not so wrong, it’s the end of the world! It’s done!
cause you are gone.

A million tears cannot wash up the sorrow that you made me feel;
A million of memories I try not to follow, but I cannot heal,
My heart is too ill
I thought that we can go on
But you chose to go alone
Go away! Now I’m done!

Chorus:
I would give you my love, but it wasn’t enough for us to make it last;
The Maya were not so wrong, it’s the end of the world! It’s done!
cause you are done.

Bridge:
I gave you all that I had
But you broke my heart instead
I built a future for us
But you betrayed all my trust
I thought that we can go on
But you chose to go alone
Go away! Now I’m done!
