Nothing comes from dreams but dreams
Still you believe in wonder
Something happens and it seems
Like a strike of thunder

Nothing comes from love but love
Why is it growing stronger?
I am falling from above
I will wait no longer

I’m like a butterfly
Spinning ‘round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
It’s stronger than me
My gravity
My gravity

Nothing comes from pride but pride
My way is clear
Dancing on the edge tonight
Now I feel no fear

I’m like a butterfly
Spinning ‘round a sword as if to dare
I should have stayed up high
It’s stronger than me
My gravity
My gravity

I’m like a butterfly
My gravity
I’m like a butterfly
and I should have stayed up high
It’s stronger than me
My gravity
My gravity
Gravity!
