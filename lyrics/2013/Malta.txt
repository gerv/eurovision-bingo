His name is Jeremy
Working in I.T.
Never questions why
He has always been
An extra careful guy
Sensitive and shy
Risk assessment is his investment
In a life of no surprise
‘Til she walked into his life

She spontaneous indeed
Uncertainty’s her creed
She has always been
Neither black or white
Just a curious delight
She threw affection
In his direction
A collection of her smiles

And to his surprise

She’s like tomorrow
Oh so distant
She just wants to play
Like tomorrow
She is always
One day away
All the time she slips away
It’s close but yet so far
It’s time to follow her tomorrow

Oh oh time to follow her tomorrow

He fell for her too fast
We all thought it wouldn’t last
Cos good ol’ Jeremy
Likes his rigorous routine
Cos he only thinks today
But tomorrow is her way
So find a new direction
And you will be ok

She’s like tomorrow
Oh so distant
She just wants to play
Like tomorrow
She is always
One day away
All the time she slips away
It’s close but yet so far
It’s time to follow her tomorrow

Oh oh time to follow her tomorrow

She’s like tomorrow
Oh so distant
She just wants to play
Like tomorrow
She is always
One day away
One day away
One day away
And all the time she slips away
It’s close but yet so far
It’s time to follow her tomorrow
It’s time to follow her tomorrow
It’s time to follow her tomorrow
