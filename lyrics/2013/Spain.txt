A blue sky
sweeps away the storm
that darkened my heart.

And then you come, with everything you are,
discovering me as I am.

You’re that light
that crosses the universe
you
urge me to fly
with you till the end.

All the hope
of life before us,
a life beginning right now.

Let us go
without fear;
let us proclaim that love’s won over all,
that now it’s me and you.

You’re that light
that crosses the universe
you
urge me to fly
with you till the end.

You’re that light
that crosses the universe
you
urge me to fly
with you till the end
