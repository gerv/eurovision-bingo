Love is so bright
Like a diamond in the light
Love is so true
I can paint my world in blue

Love is so deep
And it makes my life complete
Like a mountain in the sky
Love is high, so high

It's my life and I know it's not forever
It's my life and I'll share it all with you
It's my life, we were meant to be together
I'll give my life to you

Love is so strong
In the heart where you belong
It's a dream, a desire
And is burning like a fire

Love is so deep
And it makes my life complete
Like a mountain in the sky
Love is high, so high

It's my life and I know it's not forever
It's my life and I'll share it all with you
It's my life, we were meant to be together
I'll give my life to you

I'll find my story and fight for my glory of love â€¦

It's my life and I know it's not forever
It's my life and I'll share it all with you
It's my life, we were meant to be together
I'll give my life to you
