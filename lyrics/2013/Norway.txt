A cocoon
in a silent tree
through the dark night
you listen to me
when I whisper
broken words
in your ear
And you push
you push me hard
to the surface
I'm blinded at heart
but you wake me
wake me up
from the snow
where I was born
Now I can see
the whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
I feed you my love
You put a knife
against my back
and you dare me
to face the attack
you say for cowards
there's no reward
Feel the heat
Take my hand
I trust your word
bring the fire
I don't care if it hurts
I have the future
on my tongue
Give me a kiss
Now I can see
the whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
You put a knife
against my back
and you dare me
to face the attack
you say for cowards
there's no reward
I have the future on my tongue
Now I can see
the whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
feed you my love
So I feed you my love
Lyrics in English (if not the performed language) A cocoon
in a silent tree
through the dark night
you listen to me
when I whisper
broken words
in your ear
And you push
you push me hard
to the surface
I'm blinded at heart
but you wake me
wake me up
from the snow
where I was born
Now I can see
the whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
I feed you my love
You put a knife
against my back
and you dare me
to face the attack
you say for cowards
there's no reward
Feel the heat
Take my hand
I trust your word
bring the fire
I don't care if it hurts
I have the future
on my tongue
Give me a kiss
Now I can see
the whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
You put a knife
against my back
and you dare me
to face the attack
you say for cowards
there's no reward
I have the future on my tongue
Now I can see
the whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
feed you my love
So I feed you my love
