It’s been a long time running
‘Cause I had some things to see
I had to meet some people
Who were there to believe in me

I’m taking all that struggle
Reminds me what I’m fighting for
I’m living it up, I ain’t gonna stop
Till I make that final score

And I’ll keep running as fast as I can
I’ll keep running
I won’t stop, I won’t stop, no no

Hey now, if you push me down I’ll get up again
Hey now, if you let me drown I’ll swim like a champion
I’m sure there’ll be good times, there’ll be bad times
But I don’t care ’cause I’m running on air
(Running, running) Yeah

Give me a million reasons
But my answer stays the same
You can try to put me in a box
But I’m doing it my own damn way

See I can’t stand them talkers
All pretending that their lives’ a mess
‘Cause whatever you want, whatever you need
You gotta get off your…

And I’ll keep running as fast as I can
I’ll keep running
I won’t stop, I won’t stop

Hey now, if you push me down I’ll get up again
Hey now, if you let me drown I’ll swim like a champion
I’m sure there’ll be good times, there’ll be bad time
But I don’t care ’cause I’m running on air

Hey, I’m running on air
Running, running on air
(Oh whoa… oh whoa…) Running, running
Now I don’t care

Hey now, if you push me down I’ll get up again
Hey now, hey now

Yeah… (Oh whoa… oh whoa…)
You can push me, push me down
(Oh whoa… oh whoa…) Hey now
But I’ll get up again

I’m sure there’ll be good times, there’ll be bad time
But I don’t care ’cause I’m running on air
