(Laying down my armour, laying down my gun)

You’re lost in my game but your love is repeating
Always around, you’re never holding me down
I know who you are, true colours are showing
Though my heart’s bare, always show you care

Putting up my walls so I last better
Don’t know why I do it because we’re together
Always holding back from you
It’s on my mind

Tonight I’m gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I’ve held inside
Show you all the love I’ve held inside
Let’s do it right

Tonight I’m gonna show you, show you what you’ve done
I’m laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I’m gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am, so you know where I am

I’ve known it’s not right, just couldn’t reveal it
Always closing up tight and never releasing
Afraid and I fear to love, but you never let me go
I’ve held it in my heart and now I’m letting you go

Tonight I’m gonna show you, show you what you’ve done
I’m laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I’m gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am, so you know where I am

Putting up my walls so I’ll last better
I don’t know why I do it because we’re together

Tonight I’m gonna try for you real harder
Show you all the love I’ve held inside
Show you all the love I’ve held inside
Let’s do it right

Tonight I’m gonna show you, show you what you’ve done
I’m laying down my armour, laying down my gun
Tonight I’m gonna hold you closer than before
So you know where I am, so you know where I am

So you know where I am
(So you know where I am, so you know where I am)
So you know where I am (So you know where I am)
Oh, so you know where I am
