Cry no more, cry no more

Though the hallway catches light
It won’t reach the corner where you strongly fight
Here in the shadow

At this place they know the game
Outside the world will turn and feel the same
There in the sunlight

But you are so much more to me
Than the one who carries all the burden
I can only hope once you fly you’ll be free

You should never cry, no more
Feeling all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it’s time to turn the pages

We’re gonna stand in line and not give up
But walk that road that everybody goes
Through lights and shadows

Every time the candle glows
It lightens up the space but no one knows
Will there be a dark side?

Every battle’s victory
Is a double feeling when you cannot be
Here in the spotlight

‘Cause you are so much more to me
Than the one who lifts us on your shoulders
I can only hope once you fly you’ll be free

You should never cry, no more
Feeling all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it’s time to turn the pages

We’re gonna stand in line and not give up
But walk that road that everybody goes
Through lights and shadows

On a scale of one to ten
You got the biggest score, you’re heaven sent
No one will doubt that you’re an angel

So what went wrong this time?
Hurt nobody, did no crime
What’s with the universe? Why you?

Cry, no more, feeling all alone and insecure
You have been going through these stages
Now it’s time to turn the pages

We’re gonna stand in line and not give up
But walk that road that everybody goes
Through lights and shadows
