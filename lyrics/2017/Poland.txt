Like a bullet from a smoking gun
They try to tell us that we don’t belong
Creeping round at the depth of night
Just two shadows in love, we were ghosts

Two hearts, we’re invincible
When we’re together we’re untouchable
Haunted by if it’s wrong or right
Shadows in love, we were ghosts

Fire, like a burning desire
Taking me higher, walk in a wire
We will never come down

It’s like a flashlight burning in our eyes
You call the dogs off, I got them hypnotised
You never catch us, take us by surprise

Running faster at the speed of life
Falling deeper, got you in the sight
Bringing down your eyes in the sky

Like two animals on the run
Not afraid to fly into the sun
Invincible, we don’t leave a trace
We’re shadows in love, we were ghosts

Fire, like a burning desire
Taking me higher, walk in a wire
We will never come down

It’s like a flashlight burning in our eyes
You call the dogs off, I got them hypnotised
You never catch us, take us by surprise

Running faster at the speed of life
Falling deeper, got you in the sight
Bringing down your eyes in the sky

Yeah…
Oh whoa… yeah…
