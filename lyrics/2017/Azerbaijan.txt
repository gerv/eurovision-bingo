Standing in a mirror lane wondering what to do
Another day and gravity’s got, got another hold of me
I never dreamed that this could be happening, not to me
But there he came falling down, falling so hard I started believing

Now I’m into daydreams
Amazed by thorn jeans
Deep into high extremes

When I’m with him it’s fantasy
We’re just like alchemy
Oh, I feel ready

Have my skeletons
(I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions
(Talk is cheap, don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)

Drum drum drum, bring out the guns
(Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so, so cursed
(Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)
Bad boy

The world is spinning faster by the minute and I’m longing to be saved
This bitter sweet sensation got a, got another hold of me

Now I’m stuck in daydreams
Surrounded by thorn jeans
Deep into high extremes

When we hook up it’s fantasy
We’re just like alchemy
I’ve never been so ready

Have my skeletons
(I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions
(Talk is cheap, don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)

Drum drum drum, bring out the guns
(Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so, so cursed
(Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)
Bad boy

(I can only trick you once, bad boy)
I can only trick you once
(Talk is cheap, don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
(Talk is cheap, don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)
Talk is cheap, don’t speak in tongues

Drum drum drum, bring out the guns
(Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
Bad boy, fuss and fight won’t get you tons, bad boy
(Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)

Have my skeletons
(I can only trick you once, bad boy)
Have my lungs, my millions
(Talk is cheap, don’t speak in tongues, bad boy)

Have my skeletons
(Drum drum drum, bring out the guns, bad boy)
I’m so, so cursed
(Fuss and fight won’t get you tons)

Have my skeletons
