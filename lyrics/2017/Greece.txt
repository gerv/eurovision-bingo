Holding on to what we had can be so complicated
Could be time to move along and face it, no more debating
Watched the river running dry
Now it’s time to say goodbye

There’s an echo in my head
There’s a story still unread
And I need you here tonight

Walk away, don’t turn around
I will never let you down
I won’t let you see me cry

There’s an echo in my head
There’s a crossroad up ahead
How I want you here
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I’m not giving up

This is love
Reaching out for the stars
You and me as one
Everywhere this is love

This is love

Holding on to what we had can be so self-destroying
Remember how we laughed and played around till night met the morning?
Watched the sun set in the sky
There would never be goodbye

There’s an echo in my head
There’s a story still unread
And I need you here tonight

Walk away, don’t turn around
I will never let you down
How I want you here
Forever and ever and ever and ever
I’m not giving up

This is love
Reaching out for the stars
You and me as one
Everywhere this is love

This is love
Reaching out for the stars
You and me as one
This is love
