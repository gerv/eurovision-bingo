I come alive inside the light of the unexpected
Maybe I thrive outside the comfort zone
What is a prize without a fight? Yeah, I got addicted
To what I thought I wanted, and all along

I’ve been walking asleep, dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don’t break
I’m almost a sinner, nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take

I’m not afraid of making mistakes
Sometimes it’s wrong before it’s right
That’s what you call a perfect life

Gathering thorns from the stems of a thousand roses
Weathering storms on the long way home
I look for the sweet in every bitter moment tasted
In every last mistake I see the other side

I’ve been walking asleep, dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don’t break
I’m almost a sinner, nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take

I’m not afraid of making mistakes
Sometimes it’s wrong before it’s right
That’s what you call a perfect
That’s what you call a perfect
That’s what you call a perfect life

I’ve been walking asleep, dreaming awake
Finding I bend but I don’t break
I’m almost a sinner, nearly a saint
Finding with every breath I take

I’m not afraid of making mistakes
Sometimes it’s wrong before it’s right
That’s what you call a perfect
That’s what you call a perfect
That’s what you call a perfect life
