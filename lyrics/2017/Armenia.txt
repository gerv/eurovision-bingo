Wanna tell a story
About a girl with history
Take it from my heart, it’s gonna be your beat
Take it from my soul, it’s gonna be your heat

Many colours and shades
So many voices to embrace
All around

Many stories and tales
She took it all into her space
Hear the sound

Hee… hee…

Over deeps, over hills
She casts her wings and now it feels
Love is mine

Flying high she became
A sun whose love and light’s the same
For everyone

Fly with me high oh high, with me high oh high
Never stop believing that love will take us high
Fly with me high oh high, with me high oh high
Never gonna stop believing that love’s for you and I

Love
Love is one

Fly with me high oh high, with me high oh high
Never stop believing it’ll take us high
Fly with me high oh high, with me high oh high
Never gonna stop believing in you and I
