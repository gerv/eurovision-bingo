They read me like a book that is open
While punching on a bag and I’m choking
I’m looking for a sign while they’re stepping on my mind
But I hide behind a simple-minded notion

I try to act cool but I’m boiling
Feeling like a fool that was chosen
Try to keep myself calm while my head was getting bombed
Really need to get that good vibe going

So when it’s all or nothing
I put my nerves in the coffin
So when it’s all or nothing
I put my nerves in the coffin

I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

Getting kinda heavy on my shoulders
Try to stand straight but I’m boneless
Got a pocket full of prose while I’m walking on my toes
And I’m coping with a map that is roadless

Got eyes in my neck but I’m absent
I’m quiet in a corner seeking action
I wanna be bold but I’m only getting old
I need to stop drowning in distractions

So when it’s all or nothing
I better get that good vibe buzzing
So when it’s all or nothing
I get that good vibe buzzing

I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

Hidden deep in that beat
There’s a calling for that leap
Got no control but I know
There’s a fire in my soul

Hidden deep in that beat
There’s a calling for that leap
Got no control but I know
There’s a fire in my soul

I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment

I’m gonna kill that voice in my head
I don’t care about falling
I’m gonna grab the moment
