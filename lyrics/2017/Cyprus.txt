No matter where you’re going
No matter where you’ll be
Wherever the wind is blowing
Let me be your gravity

I can be a hero
I can be your fantasy
Oh, I can be the cure
Yeah, let me be your remedy

Right beside you
I’ll never leave you

Let me be your heart and your company
I’ll let you be the one who can lean on me
I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Let me be your wings when you’re flying high
I’m gonna raise you up till you touch the sky
I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity
Attached inseparably, like gravity

As high as the highest mountain
As low as the deepest sea
Or wherever we settle down
Just let me be your gravity

Hey, let me be your heart and your company
I’ll let you be the one who can lean on me
I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Let me be your wings when you’re flying high
I’m gonna raise you up till you touch the sky
I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Attached inseperately
It’s all we’ll ever be
You, me, gravity

Let me be your heart and your company
I’ll let you be the one who can lean on me
I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

Let me be your wings when you’re flying high
I’m gonna raise you up till you touch the sky
I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity

I’ll catch you when you fall, when you’re falling free
Let me be, be your gravity
