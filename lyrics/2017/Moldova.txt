Hey, hey you
You will never hide what you think of me
I see your clue
Know, you worry, but it don’t meant to be

Hey, hey you
It’s your girl and maybe should sleep at home
But I’ll steal her alone

And I say
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so down
I’m not that unfounded boy
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so down
All it keeps going round and round

Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
If you knew me you’d be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
She’ll be back home till sunrise

Like the sun in the sea
She will disappear tonight with me
And I will not anymore
Do what other guys did before

Hey, hey you (Hey you)
It’s your girl and maybe should sleep at home
But I’ll steal her alone

And I say
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so down
I’m not that unfounded boy
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so down
All it keeps going round and round

Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
If you knew me you’d be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
She’ll be back home till sunrise

(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma, ma…) Oh, mamma, mamma, ma…
(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma, mamma)

(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma, ma…) Oh, mamma, mamma, ma…
(Mamma, mamma, ma…)
(Mamma, mamma)

And I say
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so down
I’m not that unfounded boy
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so down
All it keeps going round and round

Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
If you knew me you’d be surprised
Mamma, mamma, don’t be so mad
She’ll be back home till sunrise

Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma (Hey bababa…)

Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma, hey mamma, hey mamma ma…
Hey mamma ma…
