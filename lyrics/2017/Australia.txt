I can tell my your eyes you want more than this
But can we be much more beyond these sheets?
No I don’t, don’t wanna mess with your head
But my love, it’s hard to love again

It don’t come easy and it don’t come cheap
Been burned too many times to love easily
Don’t mistake me, my love runs deeps
But it don’t come easy, it don’t come cheap
No, not with me

I used to move in fast to erase my past
But it never works, no, it never lasts, no
In my mind I gotta get things right
Take it slow before I jump this time

No, it don’t come easy, no, it don’t come cheap
Been burned too many times to love easily
Don’t mistake me, my love runs deeps
But it don’t come easy, it don’t come cheap
No, not with me

And if you think I’ve got a heart of stone
You couldn’t be more wrong, oh…
You might think I’ve been afraid too long
Afraid of love

But it don’t come easy
Been burned too many times to love easily
Don’t mistake me, my love runs deeps
But it don’t come easy, it don’t come cheap

No, not with me
Oh… no, not with me
Oh… don’t mistake me, my love runs deeps
But it don’t come easy, it don’t come cheap
No, not with me
