When the world shakes us
Trying to take us out of line
Fear of tomorrow
Feelings we borrow for a time

Water so deep, how do we breathe?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight

And we don’t have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don’t want nothing more
Our love is untouchable

Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable

Our love is untouchable

When the colours turn grey
And the lights all fade to black again
We’re in over our heads
But somehow we make it back again

Water so deep, how do we breathe?
How do we climb?
So we stay in this mess
This beautiful mess tonight

And we don’t have a thing to lose
No matter what they say or do
I don’t want nothing more
Our love is untouchable

Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable

Oh no no no…

Even in the line of fire
When everything is on the wire
Even up against the wall
Our love is untouchable
