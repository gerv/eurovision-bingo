Slow down, give me some time
Turn down the volume of your cry
Let’s take time to find a place without violence
Let’s listen and hear the true meaning of silence

Time to look, time to see, time to find

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth, time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise, it’s our time to shine

Just listen, take a look around
Stop missing the things you haven’t found
You will realise there’s no common ground
There’s no compromise between the time and sound

Time to look, time to see, time to find

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth, time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise, it’s our time to shine

Time to look, time to see, time to find

Time to look into your eyes
Time to find truth, time against the lies
Time will give us a sign
I can make a promise, it’s our time to shine
