You never show the spark that makes you glow
You always run away, you always say no to the right things
Don’t try to hide the light inside of you
Today might be the day when you will make it baby

So bring it on, bring it on, I’m a dreamer
If you don’t believe it, come and see me, I will teach you
If you never try, you’ll never be alive
You are gonna miss out on this ride

Yodelei… yodele, yodele, yodeleio….
Yodele, yodeleio….
Yodelei… yodele, yodele, yodeleio….
Yodele, yodeleio….

Yodelei… wanna hear this now
Yodeleio…. gonna act really crazy
Yodelei… yodele, yodeleio….
Yodeleio….

Now what’s the use of being so confused
Of doing all this work you really don’t want to be doing?
But you’ll be fine, it’s time to feel alive
Don’t stop from reaching for the stars and keep on moving

So bring it on, bring it on, I’m a dreamer
If you don’t believe it, come and see me, I will teach ya
If you never try, you’ll never be alive
You are gonna miss out on this ride

Yodelei… yodele, yodele, yodeleio….
Yodele, yodeleio….
Yodelei… yodele, yodele, yodeleio….
Yodele, yodeleio….

Yodelei… wanna hear this now
Yodeleio…. gonna act really crazy
Yodelei… yodele, yodeleio….
Yodeleio….

Sitting alone at my desk on a 9 to 5 program, it just won’t do
Get another coffee, get another one to make it through
Don’t want this anymore

Don’t you hide that light inside of you
Come and show me what you wanna do

If you’re stuck in a place feeling incomplete
If you wanna run, feeling like a misfit
Come on sing along, come on sing this song
Say 1, 2, 3

Yodelei… yodele, yodele, yodeleio….
Just shout it, baby
Yodelei… yodele, yodele, yodeleio….
Just shout it baby

Yodelei… wanna hear this now
Yodeleio…. gonna act really crazy
Yodelei… yodele, yodeleio….
Just shout it, baby
