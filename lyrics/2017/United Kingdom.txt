Tell me your secrets, I’ll keep them safe
No sign of weakness, it’s a sign of faith
We’ll stand tall so you don’t fall

You’re not defeated, you’re in repair
Don’t have to call me, I’ll always be there
We’ll stand tall so you don’t fall

If you could see how far you’ve walked
You would see that all’s not lost

I will never give up on you
I don’t care what I’ve got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we’ll dance through this storm

I will never give up on you
You’re the one that I’m running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we’ll dance through this storm

Under the surface I see you glow
I’m right beside you, you’re never alone
Don’t let go when you’re so close

If you could see how far you’ve walked
You would see that all’s not lost

I will never give up on you
I don’t care what I’ve got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we’ll dance through this storm

I will never give up on you
You’re the one that I’m running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we’re dancing through

This madness we’re running through
There’s magic, it’s inside of you
It’s madness, it’s madness

Now you can see how far you’ve walked
The mountains climbed, the oceans crossed

I don’t care what I’ve got to lose
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we’ll dance through this storm

I will never give up on you
You’re the one that I’m running to
Just give me your hand and hold on
Together we’ll dance through this storm
