The secret of my life is never giving up
Now I’m close to you
Walking through the stars brings me to the start
When I won with you

I was waiting way too much for something good to come
And I’m a bit fragile
Was waiting way too much, it’s like an hourglass
And you like trouble

Breaking me to pieces
I wanted you to know that every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces
‘Cause every time you come around
I feel alive

Now I’m trying, I’m trying
I feel alive
I feel alive

The years I’ve been alone far away from home
Reminded me of you
My job is almost done
Baby I can now escape away with you

I was waiting way too much for something good to come
And I’m a bit fragile
Was waiting way too much, it’s like an hourglass
And you like trouble

Breaking me to pieces
I wanted you to know that every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces
‘Cause every time you come around
I feel alive

Now I’m trying, I’m trying
I feel alive
So alive

Alive, alive, alive, oh…
Alive, alive, alive

Breaking me to pieces
I wanted you to know that every piece broke from you
Breaking me to pieces
‘Cause every time you come around
I feel alive
