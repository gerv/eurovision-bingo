Will you take me to paradise?
With you nothing ever dies
You take my smile and make it bright
Before the night erase the light

I won’t go below silver skies
The only dark is in your eyes

Will you take me to paradise?
With you nothing ever dies
You take my smile and make it bright
Before the night erase the light

I won’t go below silver skies
The only dark is in your eyes

Embrasse-moi, tell me that you love me
Embrasse-moi
Embrasse-moi, tell me that you love me
Embrasse-moi
